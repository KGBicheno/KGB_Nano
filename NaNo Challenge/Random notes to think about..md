I already want to get sketches done of these charaacters. 

Titles are shitty guides but solid reflections after the fact

Take breakes or you will break yourself, but define when and what you'll do for those breaks before you take them or they're just distractions. 

Don't know what to write next, rewrite a scene from a past failed NaNo project but with this year's characters and context.

OH NO! A DESCRIPTION OF CLOTHES!!!!!

Sometimes it's okay to go back and change a small detail here and there to foreshadow something - or you can leave a note in the current place in the text that you need to go back in future drafts and foreshadow something more.
