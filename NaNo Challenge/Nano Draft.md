# Whatever will be, will be

At this point, he sat there, not knowing whether his contact was going to come up with the goods. Rain belted down on the windshield. A crowd had begun to form around his car, a rare site these days. 

All he needed was a single prompt. One prompt and then he could fire up the engine and get out of this neighbourhood. 

A phone call, that was all it took. He looked out through the fogged windows to see if any of the shapes moving in the dark were familiar. If any of them were moving to his passenger seat.

He was inside the car before he could fully take stock.

"We can make them believe it for you wholesale," his contact began. The rain had ruined the man's clothes and was now doing the same to the car's leather seats.

"That sounds ominous," he replied.

His contact was out of the car as quickly as he'd jumped in. He jammed his thumb on the starter button, mis-aiming and torturing his thumbnail again. The vehicle vibrated at a different frequency to the rain and he pulled away from the crowd with one sweep of the steering. 

"Wholesale?" he thought. Years ago he'd have lit up a cigarette.


# Family is what you make, not where you're born

"Hey Feathers," Maggie said as he dropped his saturated coat into the laundry pile. The small hallway had a stack of packages that hadn't been there this morning.

"Hiya Mags, who's all this stuff for?" he asked. 

Mags appeared from the end of the hallway, a wooden spoon in hand as if they were still blowing on it to cool its contents. 

"Careful, they're for Turtle," they said. "I think they're the new server parts she's been waiting for."

Feathers tried to inch back but realised he was in no danger of hitting any of them. Most of the packages and crates were made of metal or prox-blox. Either one would have open his skin on a careless trip rather than damage whatever was inside anyway. 

Mags had a few skillets going in the kitchen pod. Their arms reaching deftly for this handle and that untencil with grace feathers couldn't possibly match. All four arms moved with a music synchoronicity. 

"Is Wombo home?" Feathers asked, loud enough that Mags could hear it and loud enough that Wombo himself could hear it if he didn't have his hearing tuned to music instead of the outside feed. 

"Wombo is home!" 

The door next to where Feathers stood flashed open and he was bound up in an enormous hug, the cold and the stress of the day melting away as his partner's embrace enveloped him. Feathers moved his arms to return the embrace and they cuddled until Wombo, a good head taller and half again the mass of Feathers realised how damn and cold his partner was. 

"Mags, gorgeous," he said, "Turtle got the shower and Kitchen pods working independely again didn't she?"

Mags turned, still cooking as they did so, though Feathers could now see a security console floating in the mix as well, and nodded.

"The reason it kept tripping up was because she and feathers kept turning it into their little love next and burning out the recyling units."

Wombo slid his arms under Feather's shoulders and shook him about - gently, but playfully. "I told you those long showers were going to break something."

"That's not what you said it would break," Feathers replied, wincing and covering his crotch as if remembering some pain. 

"Hey, Turtle's rough on me, how do you think I'd expect her to treat you?"

"It's arrived!" Turtle yelled from the apartment door. 

"Hey Turts!" Wombo boomed down the hallway, waving and blowing kisses.

"Hi sweety" Feathers called out.

"Dinners almost ready," Mags said as their two lower arms pulled plates and cutlery from the cupboards next to them.

Turtle managed to pull herself away from the crates and boxes in the hallway long enough to join a big hug between all four of them. While Feathers had relaxed into his welcoming hug, Turtle seemed to bring with her a near overwhelming sense of excitement. 

"What is that you're cooking?" Turtle asked. She sniffed at the air and then at Mags. Mags used two of their arms to brush their red hair behind their shoulders while crossing the other two defensively. Wild mushroom with vat-meat and organic salts. 

Feather's frowned. "I thought we agreed everything was going to be vat-grown from now on?"

Turtle grabbed Feather's hand and pulled him into a supportive hug, one arm over his shoulder, nodding in agreement. 

Mags looked at Wombo, who had his palms stretched out. "Come on you all, I need something natural every now and then. It doesn't feel right eating nothing but what comes our of a lab."

Feathers leaned his head back and whispered something lewd, into Turtle's ear so that only she, and quite possibly Mag's, could hear it.

Turtle blushed and elbowed him in the side. She let him go and gave the rest of the household each their welcome-home kiss before heading to her room and latching the door open. 

"I'll get the eating area configured," Feathers said over all the movement. 

"Thanks hun," Mags replied.

# Boxes, crates and not exactly humans

Feathers was halfway through his steak when the memory of real meat came back to haunt him. It came paired with the distant memory of a gag reflex and a pain in the lower gut, but neither put him off his meal.

Mags saw the change on his face. 

"I don't think I could have found real meat even with contacts like yours, sweetheart," they said. 

Feathers looked up to see the deep empathy written across Maggie's expression. He also caught the resigned disappointment on Wombo's face. 

"You're not missing out on anything, Wombo," Feathers said. "It tastes exactly the same, there's literally no difference. We didn't even have to hunt for it."

Wombo raised an eyebrow. "So you really believe there was a time humans didn't have to hunt for their food?"

"Turtles," Maggie said. "How long has it been since Wombo streamed anything educational that was vetted by anyone with a class 3 rating or above?"

Turtles didn't reply, her head was buried in a technical console as she ate. Its glyphs seemed familiar but far too complex for him to follow. 

Wombo pointed at Maggie, his elbow rocking the dinner table as it came down harder than he'd intended. "Those class ratings are only there to enforce a certain world view of what really went on back - "

Maggie slapped themselves in the face. "I can't believe you have access to the best streams anyone in the hive can hack and you still watch that shit."

Turtles didn't look up when she said, "It's tempting to think we were once given meaning by something as simple as 'fire, food, fuck' even all the way up until the point where we had space travel and post-scarcity."

"Do we really have post-scarcity? What about a scarcity of meaning? Besides keeping ourselves entertained and distr - "

"Mate, for fuck's sake," Feathers said as he stood.

Turtles turned away from her console. "Feathers ... "

Feathers walked to the opposite side of the table and wrapped his arms around the larger man's shoulders, resting his head lovingly next to Wombo's. 

"You sounded like a Digger just then, Squish," Wombo said. Maggie giggled. Wombo was nearly twice the size of Feathers, and the running joke was that the larger two had to be extremely careful during lovemaking, hence the nickname. 

"It's okay, Wombat," Feathers, said. "Just don't go watching that shit about humanity being a warrior species, okay? For my sake. I love you, just do it as a favour for me. And never call this family of ours a distraction or a lack of meaning. We all, including you, put incredible amounts of effort into building this loving safety net for each other. Finding ourselves in the hive was a greater hunt than anything our ancestors made with spears."

Maggie was the only one not starting at Feathers in shock as he looked up.

"You all knew I was the oldest one here," he said, in an accent none of them had heard before. None of them except Maggie.

"How old are you, Squish?" Wombo asked.

Feathers smiled. "Not so old that we shouldn't be - "

"He saw the Fleet Marshall rise to power," Maggie said between mouthfuls of mushroom. "I imagine you were a child when he was born, yes?"

"Fuck's sake, Mags," Feathers said.

"You're not just a little older than me," Turtles said, snapping her fingers until sparks flew from the inplants she used for her work. "You're nearly a century older than me. Two older than Wombo."

Feathers grabbed what was left of his steak and began eating it as he gather his gear to go out. "Aint one of you kints younger than a century old except for Mags, and they seem fine with this."

"We might be related, you know." Maggie said. They held out their arm and let a rush of pale blue light ripple along their skin. 

Feathers swallowed. "Nah mate, I know your family, no relation."

He was half way down the corridor to the exit when Maggie called out, "You got a clue, didn't you?"

Feathers opened the door and leaned to turn back. 

"Yeah, yeah I did," he called back. "'We can make them believe it for you wholesale', that's all he could give me."

The door closed behind him as Maggie began swearing.

# The long chain to the right link

He ditched his vehicle on one of the outer roadway's many parking spots. The public transit system hub nearby was barely a minute's walk away. Before he left his park, he looked up along the megastructure of the hive. He'd never had verticgo before they started building these things. 

For some reason, looking down their kilometre's tall external walls was easier than looking up. He dulled the sensation of his inner ear. Sounds became muted, but then so did the sense that he was about to fall to his death. Roadways, monorails and freightrails clung to the side of the giant structure. Its outside had been made red by the century it had spent assaulted by the desert, the layer of rust somehow protecting the deeper layers of armour protecting it from the elements. 

He used to know how it worked. He could probably recall the knowledge from an implant but couldn't remember if he'd stored it in one. A transit car roared past behind him going in the opposite direction to where he intended to go. He'd make it to the platform just in time. 

"If you see anything suspicious, like an unattended bag or citizen showing signs of discomfort or illness, do your part and report it to the - " Feathers turned off his ability to hear public service announcements below a certain criticality level. He found his platform and looked around. An empty seat had opened up next to a person with the most nervous expression he'd seen since he'd asked Wombo out. He sat down next to them and tried to look like the monotrain was late and bugging him as well.

"They can never get these things to run on time," Feathers said.

The other had been looking right at him when he'd said it, even though he'd been looking straight ahead. 

"I think it's on time so far," the nervous commuter said. 

Feathers turned as if he hadn't expected the response. He was back to speaking in his collequial accent now.  "Oh," he tapped the timepiece emitter on the orbit of his right-eye. 

"I've always got this thing set wrong," he said. "You okay? If someone's giving you a hard time ... "

"Oh no, I just broke a - " the commuter's nerves took over several of their movements as they blurted out a response. Feather's imagined they hadn't meant to say so much. He finished it for them.

"Promise?" he asked. "You weren't supposed to be showing up alone tonight were you?"

"Ha!" the commuter said, blurting it out. They relaxed and then gave a lopsided grin. "I told my mother that her little girl had finally found someone to take home to her. She's a bit old fashioned and was sick of our family meetings being a one-on-one affair." 

Feathers swallowed his self-consciousness and a fair dose of self-loathing as he said what he'd come to say. "But your boss skipped out on you, yeah? Said it wasn't appropriate as soon as he realised it was a romantic deal?"

"You're too clever for your own good, mister," she said.

"I'm too clever, or rather, too devious to date," Feathers replied. "But, I am just the right amount of devious to lie to your mother about who I am. What's your boss's boss's title?"

"Ha! You can't be serious?" she asked. 

The monotrain came into view and the commuters all stood. Feathers stood to, spinning as his outfit changed mechanically and chromatically. His two-piece showed that he'd been a member of the administrative section for at least long enough to have a a second-cadre security clearance - rare enough only half way up the hive, The white-with-blue accents of the armoured sections showed that he was expected to see combat, but not outside of diplomatic engagements. 

He wasn't so good-looking as to be a real catch, but he presented as though he'd been around long enough - or accomlished enough, to be trusted with protecting and administering some low- to mid- level diplomat on behalf of the hive.

She looked him up and down as the monotrain began to stop.

"What's in it for you?" she said, her voice rising over the noise from the crowd and monotrain.

"I need someone to pretend to be my sister next week."

She slowly nodded as if relieved. "You got yourself a deal," she said, taking his arm in hers as they stepped onto the waiting monotrain.

By the time they stepped off, most of the way around the other side of the hive, they had a cover story for their entire relationship. Of course, it had to involve him putting himself in harms way, but her being the one to actually save the day. One of his service badges, something that, had she been caught wearing it there would be no repercussions, made its way onto her lapel, as a sign of her 'civilian bravery commendation'. 

Her mother's apartments were in a well-kempt part of the Hive, and Feathers began to realise his outfit may only just be enough to pass as acceptable here, let alone impressive. Waterfalls and gardens with high-roofed sections told them which way to go.

"You haven't told me your name," Feathers said. "Might want to get that out of the way. Maybe a pet name too?"

"Morgan", she said. 

Feather's snorted. "Did you parents name you after the Fleet Marshall or did you choose it?"

"Then call me Flowers, Feathers and Flowers. I've always been a bit of a botanist at heart. Besides, wouldn't a Secondary Adjunct have a rank, not just a job title?"

Feathers had to pull this one out of an implant. "Lieutenenat," he said. "An officer, but only just."

"Ohhh, good, that works nicely. Not too unrealistic that a researcher would fall in with an officer."

Feathers heard the word 'researcher' like it had tapped him enough times to start a small bruise. "What exactly do you research?"

The dark-haired woman with the deep oak skin common to the Hive tapped the entry button to an ornate apartment entry. "I study Medici family history," she said. "I study the Fleet Marshall's children."

The door slid open to reveal a split-level space with a garden up one wall and stairs up the other. Tapestries with the unmistakable plain circle symbol of the Medici family hung above the stairs, giving the metal walls a more noble and, to him, baroque, feel, than anywhere he'd been in a long time. 

The top level had a large dining table, an oblong window to the desert outside, and a woman who could have been a more stately but fair-skin clone of Morgan. She leaned on a railing and greeted them.

"Morgan! My dear, and a guest! It is a pleasure to meet you, sir. To whom do I have the pleasure?"

Feathers let his arm slip from Morgan's and bowed. "Lieutenant Feathers Brightly, Ma'am. I'm afraid that in our excitement, Flowers has only referred to you as Mum, or Dear Mother."

"Flowers!" the woman chuckled, her smile full of mirth. "Such a fitting pet name, and a Second Adjunct. You can call me Don, young man."

Feathers made  show of looking around as Don led them to the dinner table. "Flowers was telling me that her research included the Medici family, but I would have imagined that the Systems Governers would look unfondly on such outright shows of interest on those who left after the split."

Don looked around and smiled. "They would, and we'd both be thrown into jail or something."

Don began to look more relaxed as he began to feel certainly less so. Even Morgan looked tense.

"Is this a test?" he asked. "Am I supposed to be turning you in as dissidents or something along those lines?"

Hovering drones brought out their dishes and they began to eat. 

"I'd hope not, especially not to your girlfriend," Morgan said.

Feathers shifted in his seat and blushed. He had three partners at home but the idea of Morgan being his new girlfriend, even a fake one, still excited him somewhat. 

They spoke about the new Hive Administrator and their policy of renewing funding to keeping the Nile River from being impacted by the Hive's enormous nearby microclimate. 

They spoke about the latest, and rumour had it, last mission outside of the Earth-controled systems.

"I heard from one of the magistrates that they've named it the 'Bedtime Stories for Adults'," Morgan said. "Such a quirky name."

"Not if you're from any of the Seven Hives," Don said. "You should know that."

"It still sounds too sympathetic to the seperatists," she said.

"It's a translation from an indigenous Canadian language into English," Feathers said. He leaned forward and smiled. It's a little rough pronouncing it unless you translate it."

A sound chirped from Don's hairpiece. "Morgan, sweety," she said. "You have a call on the terminal downstairs. I'd be much obliged if you could get me out of a spot of trouble, please."

Feathers was sure he didn't react. 

Once Morgan was gone, he turned to continue the conversation, only to see Don leaning forward and staring at him. 

"You put on a very convincing accent, Major Rafter," she said.

Feathers gripped for the nearest implement and braced to launch himself back over the railing. "I have no idea why you're implying I am someone I'm not, but if this is a way of saying you'd rather I'd not date your daughter - "

"Oh come on, Richard," Don said. "Put the fork down and relax, it's not as if you haven't been in the pants of one of my decendants before."

Feathers dropped the fork but kept his legs ready. "Ambassador? Madonna Medici?" 

Don shook her head as if she were loosening her hair from a band. When she stopped, it was the same, but the illusionary effect had gone - he could now see that she was indeed the Fleet Marshall's mother. 

He wanted to bow, to curtsey, to salute - but knew enough that the Medici's shunned all form of social heirarchy. He put his hand out to shake hers and felt himself weeping. Feathers had taken his name ironically, he was thin but intensely strong, but Don pulled him into a hug as if he were a child completely overpowered. 

"You did all you could at the River, Major," she said. "It was you and your people or them and theirs."

"I can't even remember anymore," he said. His crying was quiet, he glanced down to where Morgan may have been coming up the stairs at any moment. "It's been so long, I can't remember their - "

He saw that Madonna's arms had started swhirling with blue starlight. He felt her palm gently rest on his forehead - then push him back into the air, holding him as if on a cushion of air.

"Remember."

*He ran until his lungs filled with the ice-cold sand of the river basin. Amid the dust he saw a rocky outcropping large enough to cover the four of them. Tracer fire pinged off his helmet.*

*"In here!" he yelled. "Down, down, down."*

*The three scouts and the journalist slid in behind the outcropping as the tracer fire intensified over the top of them. The white sand swhirled and then stopped as the shock of a nearby explosive round took the wind out of their lungs. The mutuations they'd earned as Australians or by being born to Australians began repairing the torn tissues of their lungs*

*"Major Rafter!" someone said. He turned. Lieutenant Cora Lunt. Protect her. In love. Medici family. His thoughts cleared and he snapped back to reality*

*"I think we found their forward line, Lieutenant!" he shouted. "Fire a flare!"*

*"Fuck yeah!" She replied. He could still see the young woman's bright blue eyes and freckles through the patina of sand and dust that lay over everything now. Their powered weapons still strapped to their backs - dead from some new weapon broadcast from space. 
Captain Codi Liu had the thomper out and was dropping mortars in spot the quick maths on his notebook told him he'd find a target. He looked around for the journalist. He found her in the prone position next to the outcropping.*

*Her rifle was out, sights in the perfect position as she made singlular, suppressing shots in the direction of the tracing fire coming at them. Some called it Morgan's Legacy, but most knew it was the Marshall's wife Claire McKinley's influence. Nobody in Australia had to work, but they did, and to any job, one had to add 'and a reservist'. The McKinley Axiom: Peaceful But Not Undefended.*

*He slapped the back of the journalist's leg and waited for her to retreat back behind the outcrop*

*"What?" She asked*

*"Hannah! I need you to be documenting this. We're holding this point until help arrives. Get your camera out."*

*Even behind the journalist's goggles, he could see her surprise. The armiture holding her camera flicked out and began clicking and flashing. Feathers turned around to see three figures emerge from the dust. All three wore the combat fittings of the Special Circumstances unit. The shortest of the three led them, her flowing camouflage cape giving away her identity immediately - Silk. Beside her, Baroness and Kepler.*

*"So should we come in with our rifles our some mops?" Cora yelled. 

*"Thank you for pointing us in the right direction, Major," Silk said, kneeling down to where he crouched. She was so short that she almost handn't had to. "I was getting bored."*

*Kepler merely patted him in the shoulder as the freakishly tall man moved silently past him. Baroness, however, approached, put one hand up to his forehead and said "Remember?"*

He fell to the ground, once again surrounded by the ornate apartment and the dinner they'd been served. Feathers looked at her in shock. "Cora, Codi, Hannah - they didn't kill all those people, it was you three - It was you?"

Don sat back down and took a spoonful of ice-cream. "Things were a touch more specific back then. We knew what we were doing so we did them. And yes, all three of your team-mates made it off-world in the exodus. Two of them aren't even human anymore. One of them is quite happily soaring through the stars as a ship the size of this continent." 

She took another bite of ther ice-cream. "Well, not the size, but certainly she has a larger population."

"Wait, who?"

"Cora, Cora's become something more than she used to be."

"Situation sorted, mother." Morgan said from the stairs below. "You're not giving my new man a list of reasons to leave early are you?"

"No," Feathers said, " "
