# Whatever will be, will be

At this point, he sat there, not knowing whether his contact was going to come up with the goods. Rain belted down on the windshield. A crowd had begun to form around his car, a rare site these days. 

All he needed was a single prompt. One prompt and then he could fire up the engine and get out of this neighbourhood. 

A phone call, that was all it took. He looked out through the fogged windows to see if any of the shapes moving in the dark were familiar. If any of them were moving to his passenger seat.

He was inside the car before he could fully take stock.

"We can make them believe it for you wholesale," his contact began. The rain had ruined the man's clothes and was now doing the same to the car's leather seats.

"That sounds ominous," he replied.

His contact was out of the car as quickly as he'd jumped in. He jammed his thumb on the starter button, mis-aiming and torturing his thumbnail again. The vehicle vibrated at a different frequency to the rain and he pulled away from the crowd with one sweep of the steering. 

"Wholesale?" he thought. Five years ago he'd have lit up a cigarette.


# Family is what you make, not where you're born

"Hey Feathers," Maggie said as he dropped his saturated coat into the laundry pile. The small hallway had a stack of packages that hadn't been there this morning.

"Hiya Mags, who's all this stuff for?" he asked. 

Mags appeared from the end of the hallway, a wooden spoon in hand as if they were still blowing on it to cool its contents. 

"Careful, they're for Turtle," they said. "I think they're the new server parts she's been waiting for."

Feathers tried to inch back but realised he was in no danger of hitting any of them. Most of the packages and crates were made of metal or prox-blox. Either one would have open his skin on a careless trip rather than damage whatever was inside anyway. 

Mags had a few skillets going in the kitchen pod. Their arms reaching deftly for this handle and that untencil with grace feathers couldn't possibly match. All four arms moved with a music synchoronicity. 

"Is Wombo home?" Feathers asked, loud enough that Mags could hear it and loud enough that Wombo himself could hear it if he didn't have his hearing tuned to music instead of the outside feed. 

"Wombo is home!" 

The door next to where Feathers stood flashed open and he was bound up in an enormous hug, the cold and the stress of the day melting away as his partner's embrace enveloped him. Feathers moved his arms to return the embrace and they cuddled until Wombo, a good head taller and half again the mass of Feathers realised how damn and cold his partner was. 

"Mags, gorgeous," he said, "Turtle got the shower and Kitchen pods working independely again didn't she?"

Mags turned, still cooking as they did so, though Feathers could now see a security console floating in the mix as well, and nodded.

"The reason it kept tripping up was because she and feathers kept turning it into their little love next and burning out the recyling units."

Wombo slid his arms under Feather's shoulders and shook him about - gently, but playfully. "I told you those long showers were going to break something."

"That's not what you said it would break," Feathers replied, wincing and covering his crotch as if remembering some pain. 

"Hey, Turtle's rough on me, how do you think I'd expect her to treat you?"

"It's arrived!" Turtle yelled from the apartment door. 

"Hey Turts!" Wombo boomed down the hallway, waving and blowing kisses.

"Hi sweety" Feathers called out.

"Dinners almost ready," Mags said as their two lower arms pulled plates and cutlery from the cupboards next to them.

Turtle managed to pull herself away from the crates and boxes in the hallway long enough to join a big hug between all four of them. While Feathers had relaxed into his welcoming hug, Turtle seemed to bring with her a near overwhelming sense of excitement. 

"What is that you're cooking?" Turtle asked. She sniffed at the air and then at Mags. Mags used two of their arms to brush their red hair behind their shoulders while crossing the other two defensively. Wild mushroom with vat-meat and organic salts. 

Feather's frowned. "I thought we agreed everything was going to be vat-grown from now on?"

Turtle grabbed Feather's hand and pulled him into a supportive hug, one arm over his shoulder, nodding in agreement. 

Mags looked at Wombo, who had his palms stretched out. "Come on you all, I need something natural every now and then. It doesn't feel right eating nothing but what comes our of a lab."

Feathers leaned his head back and whispered something lewd, into Turtle's ear so that only she, and quite possibly Mag's, could hear it.

Turtle blushed and elbowed him in the side. She let him go and gave the rest of the household each their welcome-home kiss before heading to her room and latching the door open. 

"I'll get the eating area configured," Feathers said over all the movement. 

"Thanks hun," Mags replied.

# Boxes, crates and not exactly humans

Feathers was halfway through his steak when the memory of real meat came back to haunt him. It came paired with the distant memory of a gag reflex and a pain in the lower gut, but neither put him off his meal.

Mags saw the change on his face. 

"I don't think I could have found real meat even with contacts like yours, sweetheart," they said. 

Feathers looked up to see the deep empathy written across Maggie's expression. He also caught the resigned disappointment on Wombo's face. 

"You're not missing out on anything, Wombo," Feathers said. "It tastes exactly the same, there's literally no difference. We didn't even have to hunt for it."

Wombo raised an eyebrow. "So you really believe there was a time humans didn't have to hunt for their food?"

"Turtles," Maggie said. "How long has it been since Wombo streamed anything educational that was vetted by anyone with a class 3 rating or above?"

Turtles didn't reply, her head was buried in a technical console as she ate. Its glyphs seemed familiar but far too complex for him to follow. 

Wombo pointed at Maggie, his elbow rocking the dinner table as it came down harder than he'd intended. "Those class ratings are only there to enforce a certain world view of what really went on back - "

Maggie slapped themselves in the face. "I can't believe you have access to the best streams anyone in the hive can hack and you still watch that shit."

Turtles didn't look up when she said, "It's tempting to think we were once given meaning by something as simple as 'fire, food, fuck' even all the way up until the point where we had space travel and post-scarcity."

"Do we really have post-scarcity? What about a scarcity of meaning? Besides keeping ourselves entertained and distr - "

"Mate, for fuck's sake," Feathers said as he stood.

Turtles turned away from her console. "Feathers ... "

Feathers walked to the opposite side of the table and wrapped his arms around the larger man's shoulders, resting his head lovingly next to Wombo's. 

"You sounded like a Digger just then, Squish," Wombo said. Maggie giggled. Wombo was nearly twice the size of Feathers, and the running joke was that the larger two had to be extremely careful during lovemaking, hence the nickname. 

"It's okay, Wombat," Feathers, said. "Just don't go watching that shit about humanity being a warrior species, okay? For my sake. I love you, just do it as a favour for me. And never call this family of ours a distraction or a lack of meaning. We all, including you, put incredible amounts of effort into building this loving safety net for each other. Finding ourselves in the hive was a greater hunt than anything our ancestors made with spears."

Maggie was the only one not starting at Feathers in shock as he looked up.

"You all knew I was the oldest one here," he said, in an accent none of them had heard before. None of them except Maggie.
